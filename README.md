# System-Integration-and-Architecture
Based on the subject's name, I expect it to teach me about how systems are integrated and how their architecture is designed. It will teach me how computers, programs, and systems connect and share information. This subject will help me understand how systems like those in companies or apps we use everday are built and made to use.

I'm also expecting our professor to teach us everything we need to learn in this subject in a way that makes learning enjoyable. I want to understand how to solve problems when systems don't work properly, and how to apply solutions that will ensure that the system runs and works successfully.

In this subject, I'll try to practice and explore things so that I can learn by doing it myself. This way, I can apply what I learned into real-life situations. I hope that the skills I learned in this subject will help me through my journey as an IT professional in the future.
